On the second day of #EverydayFlutter I thought of making the UI come to life. The App is completely built with Flutter. 💙

Here's my results: 

<div align="center">
    <img src="config/get_started.png" width="200">
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    <img src="config/home.png" width="200">
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    <img src="config/home2.png" width="200">
</div>
